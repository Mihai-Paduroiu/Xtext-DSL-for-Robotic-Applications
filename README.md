# A Domain-Specific Language for ROS 2 Systems

## **Project Overview**
This project introduces a **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** designed to simplify the development and configuration of systems based on the Robot Operating System 2 (**ROS 2**). Using the **Xtext framework**, this DSL provides an intuitive and expressive approach to specifying ROS 2 systems, streamlining development workflows and reducing the complexities associated with manual configuration.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Higher-Level Abstraction**: Simplifies ROS 2 system configuration with a dedicated syntax for nodes, topics, services, and more.
- **Validation and Verification**: Built-in mechanisms ensure models adhere to semantic and syntactic rules.
- **Modularity and Scalability**: Facilitates better organization and reusability of ROS 2 components.
- **Integration with Eclipse**: Leverages Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) for metamodel generation and graphical representation.

---

## **Motivation**
ROS 2, while powerful, poses challenges due to its complexity and lack of formal validation tools. This project aims to:
1. Enhance accessibility for new users and non-programmers.
2. Improve system reliability through formal validation.
3. Provide a user-friendly platform for standardized system modeling.

---

## **Main Components**
1. **DSL Syntax**:
   - Defines rules for ROS 2 elements like nodes, topics, publishers, subscribers, and services.
   - Implements grammar constructs for a concise and expressive language.

2. **Validation Rules**:
   - Ensures systems have at least one node and executor.
   - Enforces unique identifiers for components like callbacks.
   - Maintains bidirectional relationships between elements (e.g., publishers and topics).

3. **Case Study**:
   - A sample industrial robotic system demonstrates the practical application of the DSL.
   - Models a network of robots with state tracking, measurement services, and communication protocols.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Eclipse IDE with Xtext Plugin
- ROS 2 installed on your system

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mihai-Paduroiu/Xtext-DSL-for-Robotic-Applications
   ```
2. Import the project into Eclipse.
3. Run the Xtext generator to initialize the DSL environment.

### **Usage**
- Define your ROS 2 system in the DSL editor.
- Use the validation features to ensure model correctness.
- Export and integrate the generated models into your ROS 2 projects.
